# PythonAnalysis
Building development tools for database connections, data manipulation, and common analysis algorithm implementations. The goal is to ground up everything, but due to time constraints there are several requirements beyond builtins.

# Bugs
Yep. There are quite a few. This is a side project that only gets attention when I get some free time and motivation. If you see something that doesn't add up let me know and I'll work on it when I am able.

# Features

# Examples

# Future Work
Ground up everything! (No imports beyond builtins.)
Data Visualization
